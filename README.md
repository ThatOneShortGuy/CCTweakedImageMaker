# Introduction
This program allows you to take any image and create the code needed to display it on the [CC: Tweaked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked) monitors. The program will copy it to your clipboard, as well as save it to a file. Then you can put the code into [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and get it in-game with the `pastebin get` command.
